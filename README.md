Collection of SentinelOne STAR Queries for Hunting and Creating Custom Rules

## What are STAR Queries?

STAR (Storyline Active Response) Rules are part of the Feature "Deep Visibility" of the SentinelOne EDR Product.

They represent customizable rules to detect and either kill or alarm if matching processes are started or configurations are applied on endpoints.
